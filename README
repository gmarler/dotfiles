My set of Unix "dot" files.

Currently consists of mostly Vim specific configuration.
For my purposes, this only works on Solaris 11.1 or higher.

To use this on a new machine/in a new home directory:

- Clone from github into ~, thus creating ~/dotfiles
- ln -s ~/dotfiles/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
- Update the various Vim plugins that I've configured as git submodules
  - cd ~/dotfiles
  - git submodule init
  - git submodule update

Note that you have to set up ~/.fonts correctly for the PowerLine fonts to
look right with Airline.

To do this:

1. Clone git@github.com:powerline/fonts.git
2. cd into the repo and run this for your Solaris 11.x home dir:

$ gfind . \( -name '*.[o,t]tf' -or -name '*.pcf.gz' \) -type f -print0 |
    xargs -0 -I % cp "%" ~/.fonts

$ fc-cache -fv ~/.fonts


And you're good to go!

My set of Unix "dot" files.

Currently consists of mostly Vim specific configuration.

To use this on a new machine/in a new home directory:

- Clone from github into ~, thus creating ~/dotfiles
- ln -s ~/dotfiles/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
- Update the various Vim plugins that I've configured as git submodules
  - cd ~/dotfiles
  - git submodule init
  - git submodule update

And you're good to go!

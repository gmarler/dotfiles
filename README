My set of Unix "dot" files.

Currently consists of mostly Vim specific configuration.
For my purposes, this only works on Solaris 11.1 or higher.

To use this on a new machine/in a new home directory:

- Clone from github into ~, thus creating ~/dotfiles
- ln -s ~/dotfiles/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
- Update the various Vim plugins that I've configured as git submodules
  - cd ~/dotfiles
  - git submodule init
  - git submodule update

TODO: Note that you have to set up ~/.fonts correctly for the PowerLine fonts to
look right.

And you're good to go!

UPDATE (in progress):

- Looks like the powerline developer(s) have decided that Python 2.7 or later is
  the only way to fly.  This means that using powerline may require a few
  additions to what I've noted above:
  - Install the runtime/python2.7 IPS package
  - Need to add a git submodule for the new, pre-patched PowerLine fonts:
    https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts
  - Need to add instructions on getting those fonts into ~/.fonts
